    <string name="purpose">TimeTracker helps you record the amount of time you spend on
        activities; for example, for recording time in a time sheet at work.  It
        provides ways to view, edit, and filter times, and provides a 
        time sheet report as well.</string>
    <string name="usage">
    Detailed instructions are at https://github.com/netmackan/ATimeTracker\n\n
    • Create some activities using the menu\n
    • Tap a activity to start timing; tap it again to stop timing\n
    • Use the context menu for a activity to list times\n
    • Change configuration options with the menu\n
    • View a weekly report with the menu\n
    \n
    Tapping a different activity switches timing to the other activity.\n
    \n
    The activity context menu allows you to edit activities (change their names), delete activities
    (including all of the time history for that activity!), or view the time log for that
    activity.\n
    \n
    <b>Time Log view</b>\n
    \n
    The time log for a activity is filtered on the same range that you selected for the
    main activity view, so if you filtered the activity view for <i>This Week</i> and you open
    the time log, then you\'ll only see times for this week.  Use the <i>Add Time</i> 
    menu item to manually insert times into the time log.  Use the context menu
    for a time to delete or edit a time range.\n
    \n
    <b>Note</b> that TimeTracker will not prevent you from creating times that overlap
    with times in other (or the same) activity.
