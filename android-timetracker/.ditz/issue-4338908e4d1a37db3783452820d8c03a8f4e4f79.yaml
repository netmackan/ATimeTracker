title: Change behavior of "return" button
desc: |-
  In Android, the "back" button means "save and return", whereas in Timetracker, it currently means "abort."
  This is counter to the Android standards for button behavior, so it should be changed.
  This means that all dialogs with "Save" buttons need to be changed to have "Discard" buttons,
  and the "back" button action should be to save and return.
